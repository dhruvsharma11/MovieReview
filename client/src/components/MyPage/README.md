# MyPage

My specific page allows users to view movie trailers from all the different movies in the IMDB database. If the movie doesn't have a trailer the user can submit a YouTube link and then view the trailer the next time the page is rendered. 

## Existing Movie Trailer in Dropdown (reading from database)

- 12 Angry Men
- 2001: A space Odyssey
- Alien
- Amadeus
- Batman Begins

## Entering Movie Trailer YouTube URL (writing to database)

If you want to test out if the entering trailers to a database feature works, enter any of the following links for which the movie_trailers attribute is null in the movies table and then refresh the page and select the same movie again. 

**Copy the URL only**
